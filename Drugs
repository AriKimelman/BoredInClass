#https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/27521/versions/V1/summary

#Large Dataset from US Gov

# Dataset Study Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the gendered effects of depression,
# drug use, and treatment on crime and the effects of interaction with the criminal 
# justice system on subsequent depression and drug use.

## thought process: 
# either reduce number of rows and keep all columns OR 
# create new dataset only with variables of interest 
# refer to codebook for survey questions to inspire analysis 

------------------
## Question 1: 
#What percentage of people who have tried a cigeratte end up smoking for 30 days in a row once in their life 
------------------
  
SmokeOnce_30days = sum(dataset$CIGEVER == 1 & dataset$CIGDLYMO == 1)
PercentSmokeOnce_30days = (SmokeOnce_30days/ sum(dataset$CIGEVER == 1))*100

##intepretation:
# 25% of people who have tried a cigarette smoke every day for 30 days at least once in their life

------------------
##Question 2: 
# Are there people who have done cocaine WITHOUT having done weed? 
-----------------
#Error: NA using some function 

#Solution 1: Add "na.rm"function - NOPE!

#calculate sum of no weed + yes cocaine 
WeedNoCocaineYes = sum(dataset$MJEVER == 2 & dataset$COCEVER == 1, na.rm =TRUE)

#determine number of 'yes' or 'no' to cocaine
table(dataset['COCEVER'])
yesCoc = 6746

# As a percentage 
percentWeedNoCocaineYes =(WeedNoCocaineYes/yesCoc)*100

#interpretation: 
# 2% of people who have done Cocaine have never done Weed

------------------
##Question 3: 
# Do anxious or depressed females drink more than non-anxious/depressed females?
-------------------

#ALDAYPWK Variable: This represents the number of days a week you drink. 

  WomenDrinkDepressed = sum(dataset$DEPFEM == 1 & dataset$COCEVER == 1, na.rm =TRUE)

#Error: Hist not working 

# solve attempt #1 - Failure 
breaks =c(0, 2, 4, 6)
hist(dataset$ALDAYPWK, breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6), xlim = c(min(breaks), max(breaks)))

#Solve attempt #2 - Success - Almost! (could not complete due to time constraints)

#Start by calculating frequencies of 1-7 for depressed and non depressed females 

#depressed and females 
subset_df <- subset(dataset, IRSEX == 2 & DEPFEM == 1)
freq_table <- table(cut(subset_df$ALDAYPWK, breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8), include.lowest = TRUE))
freq_table   

#nondepressed and females 
subset_df1 <- subset(dataset, IRSEX == 2 & DEPFEM == 0)
freq_table1 <- table(cut(subset_df1$ALDAYPWK, breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8), include.lowest = TRUE))
freq_table1 

##Consider different weighting based on different sample sizes of groups
#calculate as percentages 

#depressed group
perc_table <- round(100 * freq_table / sum(freq_table), 2)
perc_table 

#nondepressed group
perc_table1 <- round(100 * freq_table1 / sum(freq_table1), 2)
perc_table1

#plot demonstrating number of days a week drinking in depressed and non-depressed 
plot(perc_table)
plot(perc_table1)
 
# create barplot and colour by depression status 

percentagesDepressed = c(57.60, 32.32,  7.20, 2.88 )
percentagesNonDepressed =c(60.95, 28.21  ,8.33,  2.51)

##Interpretation:
----
#It appears women who have had a major depressive episode don't report 
#drinking a greater numbers of days a week compared to those who 
#have not had a major depressive episode. 
----- 
#concern that my frequencies are too low and are calculated incorrectly

#cannot confirm due to time constraint 

write.csv(dataset, "nacjd.csv")
-------------
## Question #4
# do people who depressive episode start drinking at an earlier age
