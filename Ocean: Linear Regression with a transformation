##Objectives:

#Use the DataExplorer package and GGally package to review dataset
#Perform Linear Regression Analysis on variables Temp & Salinity 

##dataset from
#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi

## see description of 'bottle Table' dataset from source below
#https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/

#load packages

library(DataExplorer)
library(dplyr)
library(stats)

#read in dataset
d = read.csv("bottle.csv")

#view headers
head(d)

#select variables of interest for analysis and create new dataframe
d1 = select(d, T_degC, Salnty, pH1, Depthm, O2Sat)

#Noticed inconsistency between names of variables between two website
#might be worthwhile to download dataset from original website instead of Kaggle 

head(d1)

#looked into 'NA' concern found in pH1 and 02SAT

#almost all NA below 
sum(is.na(d$pH1))

#1/4th of observations missing 
sum(is.na(d$O2Sat))

# change variables included in new dataframe due to 'NA' columns
d1 = select(d, T_degC, Salnty, Depthm)

#create dataexplorer report - temp as the response variable 
d1 %>%
  create_report(
    output_file = paste("Report", format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"), sep=" - "),
    report_title = "EDA Report - CalCOFI Dataset",
    y = "T_degC"
  )

##----------Takeaways from Report---------##

#Depth and temp moderately negatively correlated
#Salinity and temp moderately negatively correlated

# --QQ plot---
#suggests temp and salinity are normally distributed
#suggests depth not normal - will need to consider this for analysis


##--------------Building Regression model to predict Salinity by Temp and Depth-------------------------##

#replicate QQ plot seen in data exploration output
qqnorm(d1$Depthm, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d1$Depthm, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

#convert variable into log form to make it normal for regression
d1$Depthm = log(d1$Depthm)

#rerun qqplot after log transformation 
qqnorm(d1$Depthm, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d1$Depthm, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

#get an error building plot and try resolve it by changing class
d1$Depthm<- as.numeric(gsub("\\.", "", d1$Depthm))

#try to make the qq plot again 
qqnorm(d1$Depthm, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d1$Depthm, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

#run into issues of '-inf' try to solve error by rounding -inf to zero
d1$Depthm <- ifelse(d1$Depthm == -Inf, 0, d1$Depthm)

#try qqplot AGAIN - praying here
qqnorm(d1$Depthm, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d1$Depthm, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)

#Interpretation of QQplot: plot better but not perfect 

##------------Assumption Checking--------------##

## Source for reference
#https://godatadrive.com/blog/basic-guide-to-test-assumptions-of-linear-regression-in-r

# build regression model predicting Salinity using temp and depth
lm_model <- lm(Salnty ~ T_degC + Depthm, data = d1)

# Check assumption 

#linearity 
plot(lm_model,1)

#not sure what this does - didn't run it due to time constraints
plot(lm_model,2)

#Residual errors have constant variance
plot(lm_model,3)

#summary output 
summary(lm_model)


## NOTE: There second variable in the equation is in its log form

#--output interpretation--#

#Assuming that our assumptions are met, both predictors are significant
#low-moderate R-squared: R2 = 0.38
#have to consider correct interpretation given the log transformation
#I'm not able to research correct interpretations due to time constraints

# Regression Equation: yhat = 33.03 - 0.0003728(X1) - log(0.1787(X2))
